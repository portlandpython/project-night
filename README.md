### Installing Python

#### Should I use Python 2.7 or Python 3?

Unless you have a specific reason to use Python 2.7 we'd recommend that
you start with Python 3. After all, it's the future of the language.

#### Installing

* Download python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
* If you're on Mac OS X and have [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) installed,
  then you can install Python 3 with `brew install python3`.

### What Editor Should I Use?

There are plenty of great options for editing your python code. Some our
favorites are:

* [Idle]() -- Integrated Development and Learning Environment (comes with Python!)
* [Atom](https://atom.io/) -- A free and open source text editor from GitHub
* [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) -- A popular commercial text editor
* [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) -- A free and open source text editor
* [GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) -- A free and open source text editor
